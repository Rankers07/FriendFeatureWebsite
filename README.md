👥 Friend Feature Website :-
An interactive Friend Feature Web Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project simulates a basic social media feature where users can add or remove a friend dynamically with real-time UI updates.
The application focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic state management using pure JavaScript without any external libraries.

📌 Project Overview :-
The goal of this project is to replicate a simple social media interaction system where:
A user profile is displayed.
An "Add Friend" button allows interaction.
The button toggles between "Add Friend" and "Remove Friend".
The status updates dynamically on the screen.
This project demonstrates how frontend applications manage UI state changes in real-time.

🚀 Key Features :-
👤 Profile display section
➕ Add Friend functionality
➖ Remove Friend functionality
🔄 Dynamic button toggle
🎨 Real-time status update (Friend / Not Friend)
⚡ Instant UI update without page reload
📱 Responsive design 

🛠️ Technologies Used :-
🔹 HTML5
Structured the profile layout.
Created button and status elements.
🔹 CSS3
Styled profile card.
Designed interactive button styles.
Added hover effects and transitions.
Applied responsive layout.
🔹 JavaScript (ES6)
Added click event listeners.
Implemented conditional logic.
Managed friend state dynamically.
Updated UI using DOM manipulation.

🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step Logic) :-
1️⃣ The profile card is displayed with a button labeled "Add Friend".
2️⃣ JavaScript listens for button click events:
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
    // logic here
});
3️⃣ When clicked:
If current status is "Not Friend":
Change text to "Friend"
Change button text to "Remove Friend"
Update button color
If current status is "Friend":
Revert changes back
4️⃣ The UI updates instantly without reloading the page.
